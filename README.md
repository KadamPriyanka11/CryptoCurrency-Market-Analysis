# CryptoCurrency-Analysis

The Exploring the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency Market project aims to analyze and visualize the Bitcoin market and its position in the broader cryptocurrency landscape. Through Python programming, the project utilizes a CSV file from the coinmarketcap API, which contains data from December 6th, 2017. The project begins by plotting the market capitalization of the top 10 coins to showcase Bitcoin's dominance. Additionally, it explores the volatility of the cryptocurrency market by analyzing the percentage changes over 24 hours and 7 days, as well as identifying the top gainers and losers in market capitalization. The project also highlights the potential risks associated with investing in smaller cryptocurrencies, emphasizing the higher levels of volatility and uncertainty.

   #At the beginning we will analyze and cleanse the data. We will remove the NaN values from the Market_cap_usd column
